# Textbased adventure game
Here you can find my first try of an text based adventure game ([game.py](https://github.com/laeberkaes/progprojects/blob/master/Python/adventure/beta/game.py)).
The other files are for trying some classes / importing stuff and will be implemented in the game in the future.
